            <h2>r/curious</h2>
            <p>A simple web application written with vanilla CSS and Javascript with the goal of learning
                more about using APIs.</p>
            <p>The app tells you what percentage of posts on a certain subreddit mention some topic or keyword.
                It also serves as a bare bones Reddit viewer.</p>
