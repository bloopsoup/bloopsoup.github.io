                <h2>DANGERDice</h2>
                <p>A rogue-like game inspired by TinyDiceDungeons. Game engine was written in Python which
                    supports either pygame and pyglet (albeit pyglet is slower). Graphics were made in Photoshop
                    and music was made with FL Studio. Only Windows is supported currently.</p>
                <p>Play as an unassuming square, defeating people that get in your way with sheer luck.
                    Level up, make money, and collect dice to turn the odds in your favor on this strange journey!</p>

                <h2>BOGGERS.js</h2>
                <p>A lightweight Javascript engine meant for creating 2D games that can run easily on most web browsers.
                   Unlike the previous Python engine which was made to run DANGERDice, this engine features a collision
                   system and a tile map, allowing for an easier and more generalizable experience for creating levels.</p>
                <p>The source code is located on Github and the live site showcases a game demo using this engine.</p>
